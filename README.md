# 🩺 Disease Detection System using Machine Learning & Streamlit

This is an intelligent web-based **Disease Detection System** built using **Machine Learning** and deployed with **Streamlit**. The system takes user input for symptoms or medical metrics and predicts possible diseases using trained ML models. It offers an intuitive and fast interface suitable for educational or prototype healthcare applications.
